The Spread & Rest Operator
----------------------------

- It is just three dots = ...
- Called spread or rest, depending on where it's used

- Spread Operator: 
  * Used to split up array elements or object properties
  * EX:
    const newArray = [...oldArray,1,2]   <-- takes all elements from oldArray, and adds 1 & 2
    const newObject = {...oldObject, newProps:5}   <-- new object with all properties from oldObject, plus the new property newProp with the value of 5 (if it already had a newProp, it will be overwritten)

----------------------------

- Rest Operator:
  * Used to merge a list of function arguments into an array
  * EX:

    const filter = (...args) => {   <--- takes multiple arguments, turns them into an array
      return args.filter(i => i === 1);   <--- now array methods (like filter()) will work
    }

    console.log(filter(1,2,3));   <--- will return 1, as it is the only element in the argument array that === 1
