React Course Intro
--------------------

- React Components: Custom HTML elements

- Maintainable, manageable, & reuseable pieces of code you can use anywhere 

- Udemy is a React site; look up courses and they are presented in a list. The list items are react components. Each has a different image, title, description, user ratings, etc., but they are all the same structurally ("STRUCTURE SAME/DATA VARIES")

- In it's most basic form a React component is just a function.

- React, react-dom, Babel JS preprocessor (allows HTML syntax to be used in JS = JSX)

- "props" argument to a React function, contains all the attributes you add to a component

- State: allows you to change your components at run time (???)

- JSX Uppercase/Lowercase element names:
  * All elements starting with lowercase letters, are JSX elements
  * When you create your own custom components, make them Uppercase

- The React Mantra: "Everything is JavaScript."
